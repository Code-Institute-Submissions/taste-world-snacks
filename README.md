:home: 

I have had no ideas for this project and after a while I had a couple of idea to play around with. Those ideas where:
1. Make a webstore where customers can purchase products from Nepal, to suppport friend.
2. Make a webstore where customers can purchase products from around the world.
3. Make a webstore where customers can purchase subscription for a box with snacks from around the world.

It took me a couple of days pick which idea I wanted to use for my last project but I am very happy with the decision i made to go with option 3. I choose this idea because I always like to try new snacks and food when I am traveling abroad. I have found some winers that I go to after trying them on my trip or send to me. Now I know that there are already companies that do this by surpricing customers with the month box. 

I want to give customers the option of being surpriced or picking there own country box. After snacking and finding out which snack you can not live without. The customer can find different snacks from the boxes in our shop. An other reason why I decided to include our shop, is from personal experiance. Because when you find the snack you can't live without any more in a different country. The big question will be, can I find this at home? Sadly this is for a lot of things not the case. So I want to bring in the market of people that have that snack that they fell in love with but can't find it at home or after trying a box. 

I totally agree on some of the other companies that you can not keep this a secret but that you have to share this experiance with others. So customers will also have the option to give a box to someone else.
